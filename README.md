## What is it?
This is one of my assignments for the "Introduction to AI" course studied in HCMUT.

In this project, I have implemented 3 algorithms that solve the N-Queens problem. The first two are DFS and BFS, which are just trivial search algorithms and can solve for small N (< 30) in a reasonable time. The third one is an old (old but gold) heuristic algorithm named "Queen Seach"[1] which can be used for large N (~ 1 million) efficiently. I would also like to mention [3] as the (probably) fastest algorithm to solve this problem, but since it provides an explicit method, it is out of the course's scope.
